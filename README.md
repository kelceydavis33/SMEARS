# SMEARS
### Statistical Modeler for Extended Astrophysical Radio Sources

SMEARS is a modeling package. It takes observations processed through FHD (Fast Holographic Deconvolution) and converts these observations into models for the observed sources. These models take into account the diffuse components of the sources and create diffuse models
